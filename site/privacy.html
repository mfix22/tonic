    <p class="last-modified">Last modified: January 8th, 2019</p>

    <h4 id="general-information">General Information</h4>
    <p>
      Ranger is owned and operated by Dawn Labs LLC. Ranger ("we", "us" or "our") applies this
      policy to the Subscriber (the "Subscriber", "user", you" or "your"). By using Ranger, you
      expressly consent to the data handling practices described in this notice.
    </p>
    <p>
      We collect no information of those who sign up to Ranger apart from the name of the repo that
      Ranger is installed into and aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit,
      and information volunteered by the consumer. The information we collect is used to improve the
      content of our web pages and the quality of our service, and is not shared with or sold to
      other organisations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've
      requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action
          regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to
          the physical safety of any person, or as otherwise required by law.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We transfer information about you if Ranger is acquired by or merged with another company.
          In this event, Ranger will notify you before information about you is transferred and
          becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="information-gathering-and-usage">Information Gathering and Usage</h4>

          permission to access their source code in order to provide support.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ranger does not store GitHub credentials. Using GitHub apps means we do not access your
          GitHub password and that you can revoke our access at any time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4 id="data-security">Data Security</h4>
    <p>

      the security of any information you transmit to Ranger, and you do so at your own risk. We
      cannot guarantee that such information may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed
      by breach of any of our safeguards, however, we make industry reasonable efforts to ensure the
      security of our systems.
    </p>
    <p>

      periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to the Service following the posting
      of any changes to this policy constitutes acceptance of those changes.
    </p>
